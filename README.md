Here are the instructions to ensure you have Python installed and run the script successfully:

### Steps to Check Python Installation

1. Open your terminal/command prompt.
2. Type `python` and hit enter. 
   - If Python is installed, you should see a message with the Python version.
   - If no message appears, download Python 3.10.2 from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3102/).
3. Install Python if necessary.

### One-Time Setup

- Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Running the Script

- Execute the script with the following command:
  ```bash
  python main.py "your directory of txt files"
  ```
- So, for example:
  ```bash
  python main.py "C:\Users\Xiaomi\Downloads\upload-Sep07"
  ```
